* Dependencies
0. C++11
1. Eigen
2. CMake(optional if no file added)

* Run directly
Run the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd build
./hw2 [num]
#+END_SRC
where the number could be 1,2,3,4 and they are:
1. CE - gridworld   (takes a while) 
2. CE - cart pole   (should be fast)
3. FCHC - gridworld (takes very long to run)
4. FCHC - gridworld (faster than 3 but still takes a while)

* or: Compile and Run
If there are any problem running it, might need to regenerate a Makefile and compile again.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rm -r build/*
cd build
cmake ..
make
./hw2 [num]
#+END_SRC
